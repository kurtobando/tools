## Dig and Whois Tools
A simple tool for getting the DNS entries and whois records in one query.

### Why this project?
I find it time consuming if I query both DNS and Whois records in each separate designated websites. For example, for whois records, I have to check https://whois.com and for the Dig result, I have to check https://toolbox.googleapps.com/apps/dig/

With that said, I have this tool which we can query both. If you wish to check the demo page, please visit https://tools.kurtobando.com

### How to use it? 
Enter a domain name on the search area, then click on Dig Records. This should return DNS result and whois result respectively. For example:
[![Tool Result](https://snag.gy/co1A34.jpg "Tool Result")](https://snag.gy/co1A34.jpg "Tool Result")

### Tools used?
1. **UIKit** as CSS Framework.
2. **Vanilla Javascript** for simple DOM Manipulation.
